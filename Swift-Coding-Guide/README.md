#Swift Coding Guide
This style guide is different from others you may see, because the focus is centered on readability, file and code organization in xcode. I strongly believe that without a proper coding standard and file organization development is not an easy task. 
This gudie is organized in different section for better understanding.
Modification and suggestion are strongly welcome.
#1. File Organization
The physical files should be kept in sync with the Xcode project files
Any Xcode groups created should be reflected by folders in the filesystem
Code should be grouped not only by type, but also by feature for greater clarity.
